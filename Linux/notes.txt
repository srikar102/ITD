Linux:


Day 1: on-prem, Cloud
SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a powerful security module in the Linux kernel that enforces Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policies, adding a crucial layer beyond standard Linux permissions (DAC) to confine processes and users.
On-Premises (On-Prem)
•	On-prem is when your servers and infrastructure are physically located in your organization’s own datacenter (company owned buildings).
•	Company is responsible for everything — hardware, networking, power, cooling, admins and security.
•	It gives full control but requires heavy capital cost and maintenance.
Server
•	A server is just a machine/computer or software system that provides services or resources to other computers or clients over a network.
•	In today’s context, it could be a Virtual Machine, or even a cloud instance like an EC2
example: Web Server, Application Server, Database Server, File Server, Mail Server, Game Server etc.
Physical server → A real hardware machine.
Virtual server → A software-based server running inside a VM or container.
Bare Metal
Bare metal refers to running workloads directly on physical hardware, without any hypervisor or virtualization layer in between.
You get 100% of the machine’s CPU, memory, storage, and network, exactly as the hardware provides it.
Unlike virtual machines, there is no resource sharing, no noisy neighbors, and no hypervisor overhead.
Key Characteristics
•	Direct hardware access – OS runs straight on the server
•	Highest performance & lowest latency
•	Full control over BIOS, firmware, kernel tuning, CPU pinning, NUMA
•	Predictable performance (critical for real-time systems)
•	Manual scaling compared to cloud VMs
Cloud
•	Cloud is basically someone else’s computer — but with industrial-grade scalability and automation.
•	You don’t buy hardware; instead, you rent servers, storage, databases, and more on demand.
•	It lets you focus on your application or service, while the provider takes care of the messy infrastructure — power, cooling, networking, redundancy, the whole lot.
•	It evolved from traditional datacenters to offer agility — spin up 100 servers in minutes, pay-as-you-go, and scale down when you don’t need them. It’s not just cost savings — it’s about speed, flexibility, and global reach.
Public Cloud
•	Public cloud is what most people refer to when they say ‘cloud’ — platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.
•	The infrastructure is owned and managed by the provider, and you’re just renting what you need — compute, storage, databases, etc.
•	It’s cost-efficient, globally available, and highly scalable, but you share physical resources with others.
Private Cloud
•	Private cloud gives you cloud-like flexibility, but the infrastructure is dedicated to your organization — either on-prem or hosted by a third party.
•	Tools like OpenStack or VMware help you build it. It’s ideal for security-sensitive workloads, compliance, or when you need more control over your environment.
In-House
In-house usually refers to custom-built software or infrastructure managed by your own team, regardless of where it’s hosted. For example, even on cloud, if your team builds and manages everything end-to-end, that’s in-house expertise.

Day 3:  Connect to Remote EC2 (SSH)
Create an ec2 instance (Server, Virtual Machine, Node)
Step-by-Step Guide to Create an EC2 Instance
1.	Log in to AWS Management Console:
•	Go to the AWS Management Console and log in with your credentials.
2.	Navigate to EC2:
•	In the AWS Management Console, search for “EC2” in the services search bar and select it.
3.	Launch Instance:
•	Click on the “Launch Instance” button.
4.	Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):
•	Select an AMI that suits your needs (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, RHEL). You can choose from free-tier eligible options if you're just getting started.
5.	Choose an Instance Type:
•	Select the instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier). Click “Next: Configure Instance Details” after making your selection.
6.	Configure Instance Details:
•	Set the number of instances, network settings, and other details. For a simple setup, the default settings are usually sufficient. Click “Next: Add Storage.”
7.	Add Storage:
•	Modify the storage size if necessary. The default is typically sufficient, but you can add more if needed. Click “Next: Add Tags.”
8.	Review and Launch:
•	Review your instance configuration. Click “Launch.”
9.	Select or Create a Key Pair:
•	If you don’t have a key pair, create a new one and download it (keep it safe; you won't be able to download it again). If you have one, select it. Click “Launch Instances.”
10.	View Instances:
•	Click on “View Instances” to see your new EC2 instance. It may take a few minutes to initialize.
Accessing Your EC2 Instance
•	For Linux Instances:
•	Use SSH to connect. The command will look like this:
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem <username>@<your-ec2-public-ip>
For an Amazon Linux AMI, the username is ec2-user.
For a CentOS AMI, the username is centos or ec2-user.
For a Debian AMI, the username is admin.
For a Fedora AMI, the username is fedora or ec2-user.
For a RHEL AMI, the username is ec2-user or root.
For a SUSE AMI, the username is ec2-user or root.
For an Ubuntu AMI, the username is ubuntu.
For an Oracle AMI, the username is ec2-user.
For a Bitnami AMI, the username is bitnami.
Preffered SSH client: 
•	git bash Download
•	Mobaxterm Download
Day 4:  pwd, ls, tree, rm, mkdir, touch
Linux keynotes to know 
•	In Linux commands are case-sensitive (all commands are in lowercase)
•	A folder is called a Directory in Linux
•	Everything is a file in Linux, including directories, devices, and processes.
•	The root user (root) has full administrative privileges.
•	/ (root directory) is the top-level directory in the Linux filesystem.
•	Hidden files start with a dot (.), e.g., .bashrc.
•	Use man followed by a command (e.g., man ls) to see the manual page.
Unix tradition: Almost all commands follow lowercase due to Unix/Linux history and POSIX standards.
Case-sensitive in Linux: Linux treats ls and LS as different. Only ls exists, so LS gives “command not found”.
Simplicity & consistency: Lowercase keeps commands predictable and easy to type.
 
Convention	Description
-<letter>	Short option; typically 1 letter, often stackable (e.g., -xzvf)
--<word>	Long option; more readable, not usually combinable
= for long options	Long options often allow assignment (--output=file.txt)
Use --help	Most commands support --help to print usage
Option order matters	Sometimes, positional arguments matter after options
 
man command (manual)
 
man <command>
man ls
 
Common keys when reading man:
• 🔼 / 🔽 – Scroll up/down
• /<keyword> – Search for a word
• n – Next match
• q – Quit
 
pwd
The pwd command stands for "print working directory."
It prints the path of the working directory. 
$ pwd
/home/ubuntu
 
ls (list files and directories)
•	To list with details (long format): ls -l
•	To list with creation time sorted (recent at the top): ls -t
•	To list reverse order: ls -r
•	All the above together: ls -lrt (OR) ll
rm - Delete files/directories
Use the rm command to delete files and directories. But rm cannot simply delete a directory. Use “rm -r” to delete a directory. In this case, it deletes both the folder and the files in it.
    To remove/delete a file     
        rm file_name 
    To remove/delete a Directory    
        rm -r directory

cd (change directory - cd)
•	switch/change to a folder/Directory in Linux
   Syntax: cd <path>/<location>
   example: 1. To change to a Directory in the current location
                        cd test
mkdir (make directory - mkdir)
•	To create a directory: mkdir <directory_name>
           example: mkdir test
•	To create multiple directories:
      mkdir <directory_name> <directory_name1> <directory_name2> ..... <directory_name>
           note: directory names with space separated    
           example: mkdir test test1 test2 ...   
tree 
Inastall tree 
#Before installing any software/tools, refresh the package list to get the latest package
sudo apt update

#Once the package list is updated, install the desired software using apt
sudo apt install tree
The tree command in Linux is used to display the contents of current directory in a tree-like format. It recursively lists all files and directories within a specified directory.
 
1.	Display Only Directories: tree -d
2.	List All Files Including Hidden Files: tree -a
3.	Limit the Depth of the Tree: tree -L 2
4.	Display Full Path Prefix for Each File: tree -f 
5.	Print the Size of Each File: tree -h
touch
touch is used to create empty files or update file timestamps (access & modification time).

#Create a new empty file
       touch file.txt

#Create multiple files
       touch a.txt b.txt c.txt

#Update timestamp of an existing file
       touch file.txt

#Create file with full path
       touch /home/ubuntu/test.log


Day 5:  cp (copy), mv (move/rename)
cp - Copy the file from one location to another 
cp command copies files and directories through the command line. 
cp [OPTIONS] <SOURCE> <DESTINATION>
 
To copy to a different location
cp file1.txt /home/ubuntu/Dir1
To copy file and rename
cp file1.txt file2.txt
Copy a directory recursively
cp -r dir1/ dir2/
Copy multiple files to  directory
cp file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt /home/user/Dir1/
Ask before overriting file (Prompt y/n)
cp -i file1.txt /home/user/Dir1/
mv - Rename or Move the file from one location to another

rename or move the file from one location to another (mv)

•	mv command to move files and directories through the command line.
•	We can also use the mv command to rename a file/directory.
    To rename a file/directory
        mv old_filename new_filename
        mv old_directory new_directory
    To move to a different location (cut and paste)    
        mv <source> <destination>


Day 6: free, top, htop, lscpu, uptime, ps, hostnamectl
