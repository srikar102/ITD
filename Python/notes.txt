Day 20: Syntax

PYTHON COMMENTS

A comment is a line in your code that Python does not execute. It is only for humans to read.
Single-Line Comment:
# This is a comment
Multi-Line Comment:
'''
This is a multi-line comment
'''
Why Comments are Important:

PYTHON INDENTATION
What is Indentation?
Indentation means giving space at the start of a line.
Example (Wrong):
if 5 > 2:
print("Hello")
Correct Example:
if 5 > 2:
    print("Hello")
Why Indentation is Important:
- Python uses indentation to group code
- Without it, code will fail
PYTHON IDENTIFIERS
What is an Identifier?
An identifier is the name of a variable, function, or class.
Example:
name = "Bharath"
Rules:
- Must start with a letter or _
- Cannot start with a number

- No keywords allowed
Valid:
age, student_name, _total

PYTHON FILE NAMING CONVENTION
Python files must end with .py
Good names:

Bad names:
my file.py
1test.py
